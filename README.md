This repository contains the code and dataset used for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important festivals celebrated in India. The analysis aims to understand sales patterns and trends during the Diwali period.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `diwali_sales_data.csv`.
The dataset provides information about sales transactions recorded during the Diwali period, including the date, product details, quantity sold, price, and total sales amount.

## Analysis

The analysis code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: Reading the dataset and exploring its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing sales trends, patterns, and correlations.
4. Visualization: Creating visualizations to better understand the sales data.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code for your own analysis or extend the analysis further.
